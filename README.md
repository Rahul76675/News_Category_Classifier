The GitHub repository Rahul76675/News_Category_Classifier is a project that utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to classify news articles into various categories based on their descriptions.​

The dataset used includes columns such as Class Index, Title, and Description, with the Description field being used for training the model. The Class Index is transformed into numerical labels using LabelEncoder.​

The repository contains the trained model file (classifier_model.pt), the dataset (News_Category_Dataset_v3.json), and a requirements.txt file listing the necessary dependencies. There is also a src directory, likely containing the source code for training and inference.
